*"Let’s Learn and Build Cool Stuff!"*

## 📖 What’s This About?  

Welcome to **Nerchukundham**, my very first (and super simple) landing page! Think of it as my playground for learning HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. 🎢  

It’s basic, it’s fun, and it’s where I discovered that even toggling a light/dark mode can feel like magic. ✨

## 🎯 Features That’ll Make You Smile  

- **Sleek Navigation Bar**: Links that don’t go anywhere yet, but they *look* awesome.  
- **Hero Section**: Big, bold welcome text to make you feel special and a button to pretend to click.  
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Click the moon icon and watch the theme transform (bonus points for the sun showing up).  
- **Image Hover Animation**: A subtle "oh, nice!" effect when you hover over the images.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **HTML**: Holding everything together like duct tape.  
- **CSS**: Making it look way cooler than it should.  
- **JavaScript**: The brains behind the light/dark mode toggle.

## 🎨 What I Learned  

- Building a simple layout with HTML and CSS.  
- Animating images so they pop (literally).  
- Using JavaScript to switch themes and show off a little.  
- That coding is way more fun than I expected!

   ```  

2. Open `index.html` in your browser and enjoy.  

3. Click around, hover over stuff, and flip that light/dark mode switch like a pro.

## 💡 What’s Next?  

- Actually linking those navbar items to real sections.  
- Adding responsive design so it doesn’t freak out on mobile.  
- Maybe throwing in some cool fonts and better images.  
- Expanding the light/dark mode to affect *everything*!
